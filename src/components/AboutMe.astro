    </h2>

  <p class="mb-4 ">
    Back in 2017, I took the plunge into web development with my first WordPress
    website, driven by a curiosity for customizing theme, I tumbled into the rabit
    hole of coding and web development. Fast forward to today, and I've had the
    privilege of working for a startup and freelance for a huge corporation.

    My primary focus revolves around crafting products for Squared and catering
    to my client at J R Properties. During my free time, I delve into software
    architecture.

    Away from the computer, you'll find me in the gym, or immersed in the
    inviting atmosphere of Indigo bookstore, captivated by the fragrances of
    books.
